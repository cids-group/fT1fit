# fT1fit
Fast T1 mapping methods

A custom user interface tool (as an exe file) is available for download at https://sites.google.com/site/yoonckim1/software/t1_map_compare. 

The code was tested using the following specs and libraries:
- Windows OS 10
- python 3.6
- pyqt5
- pydicom==2.0.0
- matplotlib==2.2.2
- numpy==1.14.5
- scipy==1.1.0
- scikit-image==0.14.0

Use pip to install the above libraries. For example,

(ft1fit) C:\Users\yckim\Documents\t1map_cpp\gui_code2> pip install pydicom==2.0.0

To run the script and launch the graphical user interface. 

(ft1fit) C:\Users\yckim\Documents\t1map_cpp\gui_code2> python gui_ft1fit.py
